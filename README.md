# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Physicochemical-Properties-
Welcome to the Vinho Verde Wine Quality Classifier project repository! This project aims to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Using supervised classification techniques, specifically Random Forest and SVM models, we compare their effectiveness.
