# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Physicochemical-Properties-
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques for the classification of red Vinho Verde wine quality, based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset utilized in this project pertains to the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, encompassing attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol content. Additionally, the dataset includes quality scores rated on a scale from 0 to 10.

The primary objective of this project is framed as a supervised classification problem, where the goal is to predict the quality of the wine based on its aforementioned attributes.

To accomplish this goal, two distinct classification algorithms, namely Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), will be implemented, trained, and evaluated. The evaluation process will employ appropriate evaluation metrics to discern the efficacy of each model in predicting wine quality accurately. The chosen evaluation metrics will facilitate a comparative analysis of the results, thereby providing insights into the performance of both models and their suitability for the classification task.

By exploring the utilization of two different classification algorithms and employing meticulous evaluation methodologies, this project endeavors to identify a predictive model capable of accurately classifying wine quality based on its chemical composition. The findings of this project are expected to offer valuable insights into the factors influencing wine taste and perceived quality, thereby contributing to the understanding of wine production and quality assessment processes.
